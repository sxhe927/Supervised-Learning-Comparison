Datasets:
Both datasets are attached, but just in case:
Wine Quality - White
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
only need to download the winequality-white.csv

Adult
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
Download both the adult.data as training data and adult.test as testing data

Running the Code:
To run the code, you need Python 2.7.* and need to have the following dependencies installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn (scikit-learn)
- pydot
- pybrain


Simply call 'python Adult.py' to run all algorithms on the Adult dataset and call 'WQexperiment.py' to run all algorithms on the Wine Quality dataset. The results, graphs, etc should be automatically generated. 

Important Notice! - plotting in matplotlib can block the flow of code so you'll need to exit out of graphs in order to continue running the rest applications.
